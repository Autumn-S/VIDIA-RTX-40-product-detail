## Description ##

A full stack application including database, API server and website detailing a video card product similar to NVIDIA's RTX-40 series.<br/>
See https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/<br/>

The motivation for this project stems from our teams interest into the tech world. The NVIDIA website has a high level of interactivity, featuring numerous animations and presenting a challenging environment for web development. By replicating this website, we open ourselves up to a learning opportunity that surpasses what we would gain from working on a less complex site.

## Why use Tailwind CSS? ##
There are many benefits of using a CSS framework like Tailwind. Below are the major ones.
*_You write less custom CSS_. With Tailwind, you style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in your HTML. By using utility classes in this way, you can build custom designs without writing CSS.
*_You keep CSS files small_. Without a framework like Tailwind, you have to keep writing CSS as you add new features and components. As a result, your CSS files continue to grow and get heavier. By using utilities like Tailwind’s flexbox and padding utilities, most styles are reusable so you rarely need to write new CSS.
*_You don’t have to invent class names_. When Tailwind, you’re choosing classes from a pre-defined design system. That means you don’t need to agonize over picking the “perfect” class names for certain styles and components, or remember complicated ones like sidebar-inner-wrapper.
*_You can make safer changes_. With the traditional approach, if you make changes to CSS, you may break something across your site. Unlike CSS, utility classes in your HTML are local. That means you can change them without worrying about breaking something else on your site.
