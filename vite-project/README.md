# VIDIA-RTX-40-product-detail

## Description

This project was based on creating a clone replica of a product detail page for the NVIDIA RTX 4090.
See https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/

//MOTIVATION
The motivation for this project stems from our teams interest into the tech world. The NVIDIA website has a high level of interactivity, featuring numerous animations and presenting a challenging environment for web development. By replicating this website, we open ourselves up to a learning opportunity that surpasses what we would gain from working on a less complex site.

##Development Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Create your `.env` file: `touch .env`
3. Add your info in `.env`
